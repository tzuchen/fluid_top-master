Cutoffs are observed both in simulations of $A$ and $A^T$.

\oursection{A Lower bound of the Process}
In each row of $A$, there are at most $w$($w=4$ in logistic map) nonzeros. At $k$-th iteration, there are at most $w^k$ number of states are nonzeros. This gives us an lower bound on total variation diatance.
\begin{eqnarray*}
||x^k-\pi||_{TV} \ge 1-\frac{4}{\pi}\sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{w^k}{2n}} \mbox{   , when } w^k \le 2n
\end{eqnarray*}
Note the sequence of lower bounds indexed by $n$ presents a cutoff.

Dashed line is $\omega = \frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{x(1-x)}} $, the invariant distribution of logistic map. At the $5$-th iteration, is is almost invariant!

\oursection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item
The above simulation is done analytically. It shows that once the distribution is nonvanishing everywhere, the invariant distribution is almost achieved. This might be useful to prove the upper bound after cutoff. 
\end{itemize}
