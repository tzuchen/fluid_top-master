\oursection{Stokes Equation and Darcey Flow}

\begin{itemize}
\item Generalized Stokes partial differential equation for imcompressible flow (Darcey equation)
       \begin{eqnarray*}
       ( -\mu\triangle + \mathbf{\alpha} \mathbf{I}) \mathbf{u} +\nabla  \mathbf{p} & = & \mathbf{f}\\
       \mbox{div} \mathbf{u}& = & 0 
       \end{eqnarray*}

       $\mathbf{u}$: velocity, $\mathbf{p}$: pressure, $\mathbf{f}$: body force and boundary conditions 
       $\mu$: viscosity, and $\bf{\alpha}$: inverse permeability 
\item Discrete version 
       \begin{equation}
       \left[\begin{matrix}
       -\mu \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{H} \mathbf{\bar{\alpha}}  & \mathbf{G}\\
       \mathbf{D}               &  0 
       \end{matrix} \right]
	\left[\begin{matrix}
  	\mathbf{\bar{u}} \\ \mathbf{\bar{p}}
	\end{matrix} \right]= 
	\left[\begin{matrix}
  	\mathbf{\bar{f}} \\ \mathbf{0}

	\left[\begin{matrix}
 	 -\mu \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{H} \mathbf{\bar{\alpha}}  & \mathbf{G}\\
 	  \mathbf{D}               &  0 
	\end{matrix} \right]
	\left[\begin{matrix}
	  \mathbf{\bar{u}} \\ \mathbf{\bar{p}}
	\end{matrix} \right]= 
	\left[\begin{matrix}
 	 \mathbf{\bar{f}} \\ \mathbf{0}
	\end{matrix} \right] \\
  & \mathbf{0}\le \mathbf{\bar{\alpha}} \le \alpha_M\mathbf{1}
