In this talk I try to relate the cutoff phenomenon found in large Markov chain simulation to the behavior of chaotic system with small diffusion.
page2: We simulate standard map by a Markov chain model, which is simply discretilize the rectangle domain into n by n regular grids and set each of the grid as a state. This procedure creates some numerical diffusion. 
The black/white indicate 1 and 0 of the function value.

page3: I plot the norm versus iteration plot on the left side. It shows that that for L1 norm and L2 norm, the decay trajectories have a concave part, which is super-exponential. I suspect this is a cutoff phenomenon.

page4,5,6: An example of cutoff phenomenon and the definition of cutoff given by Prof. Diaconis.
page7: more simulations of standard map with n (number of grid in x and y direction) varying from 2.5k to 80k. We numerically shows this sequence of Markov chain presents a cutoff.
 
page8: Some simple results in model reduction,
