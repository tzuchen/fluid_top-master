\begin{itemize}
\item How does the measure of uncertainty evolve when a probability distribution is transported by a chaotic map?
\item How does a chaotic map mix scalar functions?

{\bfseries Goal}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relate the above two questions to cutoff phenomenon in finite Markov chains.
\item Show evidence of cutoff in chaotic map simulations.

For a given 1-D map $S:x \mapsto x' $. The probability measure $\omega(x),x \in [0,1]$ transported by $S$ in the following way, 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \omega'(x')|dx'| = \omega(x)|dx|
  \end{eqnarray}
It is possible that there are more than one $x$ which give the same $x'$. Hence we actually have,
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \label{omegamap}
    \omega'(x') = \sum_i \left|\frac{dx_i}{dx'}\right|\omega(x) \mbox{   , for all } i \mbox{  such that  } x'=S(x_i)

  \begin{eqnarray}
  \label{tentmapevolve}
    \omega_{\mu_n}^{k+1}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left( \omega_{\mu_n}^{k}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)+
