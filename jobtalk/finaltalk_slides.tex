%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Goal: to determine the positions of the sensor nodes in a network given incomplete and inaccurate pairwise distance measurement. 
  \item Nonlinear, non-convex optimization. 
  \item A semidefinite relaxation is given by Yinyu Ye.
  \item Can only solve finite size ($\sim100$ sensors) problems. Bad in scaling.
  \item Not very robust to noise.   
  \item My contribution:
     \begin{itemize} 
        \item A gradient search method to improve the SDP solution.  
        \item A clustering algorithm based on the distance information.
        \item A parallel solver and a stitch algorithm.
     \end{itemize}

     \item Situation: low Re, high Pe.
     \item Goal: improve it by applying topology optimization on the half-cycle structure.
     \item Topology optimization rather than shape optimization.

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Generalized Stokes equation for imcompressible flow (Darcey equation).
   \item Finite difference method with staggered mesh to solve the flow field ($180 \times 30 \times 60$ fluid/structure grid).
   \item A gradient-based optimization scheme with fixed step size.
   \item Adjoint method to find the gradient direction efficiently. 
   \item A Markov Chain model to approximate the solution of the advection-diffusion equation on the cross-sections of the channel.
   \item Fourth order Runge-Kutta method to integrate streamlines.

   \begin{itemize}
   \item PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation).
   %\item Develope a package that communicates PETSc and Matlab
