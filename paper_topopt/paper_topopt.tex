\maketitle

\todo{MW: In articles and similar bib records the title is changed to
  lower case automatically by bibtex. Sometimes this results in
  phrases like Markov Chain losing their capital letters, which is
  wrong. See \cite{Diaconis1996} for an example of how to fix this by
  putting braces around the letters which must be capitalized.}
