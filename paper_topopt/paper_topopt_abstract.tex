We develop a topology optimization methodology for optimizing the
shape pressure-driven microfluidic channels to maximize the passive
mixing rate of advected tracers. The optimization procedure uses a
relaxation of Stokes flow by allowing a permeable structure and the
objective can be a function of either the fluid velocity field or the
particle map from inlet to outlet. We present two new channel designs,
one that is an optimized version of the herringbone mixer of Stroock
et al., and one that mixes more quickly by using a fully 3D structure
in the channel center. These channels deliver approximately 30\% and
60\% reductions in the 90\% mixing lengths. To compare our numerical
simulations to experiments we approximate the inlet-outlet particle
map by a Markov Chain and show that this cheaply approximates the true
stochastic map.
