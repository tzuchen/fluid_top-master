We numerically study the decay of the variance of a passive scalar
function being mixed by the diffusive Standard Map. An efficient and
parallelizable Markov Chain model is used to approximate the
Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators of the chaotic map with
diffusion. The limit of zero diffusion is approximated by constructing
a sequence of Markov Chains with ever higher resolution (up to
$6.4 \times 10^9$ states). In the limit of diffusion going to zero we
show that scalar variance exhibits a sharp decay and present numerical
evidence to suggest that this is a cutoff in the sense of finite
Markov Chains.
