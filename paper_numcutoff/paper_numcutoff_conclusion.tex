\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:numcutoffconclusion}
In our numerical simulations, we provide the evidence of cutoffs for the sequence of Markov chains generated by approximating the Koopman operator of Standard Map. The notion of a cutoff is first brought from finite Markov Chain studies to the study of chaos, and we find that not only is it suitable for characterizing the behavior of chaotic map in near zero-diffusion limit, but also it builds a bridge between large finite Markov Chain studies and chaotic maps. It is still unclear whether the Markov Chains that present cutoffs have direct link to chaos: are they discretizations or approximations of some chaotic map? We offer no good answer to this question so far. However, in \cite{symdyn} another attempt is made: we show that by choosing suitable initial distributions, a $1$-D chaotic map with symbolic dynamics can have the same limiting behavior as the cutoff of random walk on $n$-dimensional hypercube problem \cite{Diaconis1990}, and thus it demonstrates another link between these two fields.
