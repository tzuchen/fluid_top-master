We relax the definition of the cutoff phenomenon in finite Markov Chains and apply it to the study of the evolution of a probability density function by 1-D chaotic maps. A new object called a stochastic symbol sequence is developed to prove that for a set of initial distributions, the total variation versus iteration curves present cutoffs. Moreover, we can generate a set of initial probability
distributions such that when evolved by chaotic maps, they present the same limit behavior as the cutoff sequences found in specific finite Markov Chains. The results can be applied to any 1-D chaotic map which has full symbolic dynamics.
