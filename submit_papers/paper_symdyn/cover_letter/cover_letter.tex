Dear Editors,

We would like to submit our article ``The cutoff phenomenon and mixing
by chaotic maps'' for inclusion in the SIAM Journal on Applied
Dynamical Systems. This paper takes the concept of a cutoff phenomenon
from the Markov chain literature and asks whether the mixing behavior
of 1D chaotic maps (as encoded by their Perron-Frobenius operators)
can produce cutoffs. We prove that the answer to this question is
positive, at least in the case when the chaotic map has full shift
symbolic dynamics. Our proof technique uses a generalized form of
symbolic dynamics that encode probabilistic information.
