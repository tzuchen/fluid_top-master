Re: (184) Numerical Evidence for Cutoffs in Chaotic
Microfluidic Mixing

Dear Colleague:

It is our pleasure to inform you that the contribution
referenced above, for which you are listed as the
corresponding author, has been accepted for publication in
the Proceedings of the 2008 Dynamic Systems and Control
Conference (DSCC'08) will take place in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, on October 20-22, 2008.

We received 234 paper submissions for review and
evaluation, and it is commendable that your paper is among
the ones selected for publication. The advance program for
the conference will be available in August, 2008 at
http://www.dsc-conference.org

Please note that reviewers' comments and associate editor's
summary can be accessed by logging into your account and
following the link for reviews for your contribution at
http://asme-dscd.papercept.net// It is important that any
critical comments therein are adequately addressed before
the final paper is submitted.

Widely advertised conference policy requires that at least
one of the authors of your paper must have paid the
registration fee for final paper upload. One registration
can be used for upload of at most two contributions. If you
are an author or co-author of a single contribution, your
registration cannot be shared or used for uploading someone
else's contribution.

In addition, please note that all papers are limited to six
(6) pages. However, if you would like to submit a
manuscript up to eight (8) pages in length, each page above
the limit of six pages will require a pre-payment of
overlength fee of USD 200. This will be automatically
assessed at the time of final submission.

Electronic submission of the final version of your
manuscript is due by ** July 21, 2008 ** through
PaperPlaza. The final submission process also requires that
you update the abstract and make any final changes to the
author list and title of the paper before uploading. Any
authors not updated on the submission site will not be
included in the final program of the conference. If your
paper has multiple authors, please check to make sure you
have added all authors using their individual PINs.

Electronic submission for final contributions will open in
June 21, 2008. Detailed instructions regarding registration
and preparation of the final version of your paper will
shortly be available at http://www.dsc-conference.org.
Please also consult this website for further updates about
the conference.

Congratulations on this fine achievement! We look forward
to welcoming you in Ann Arbor in October 2008, for what
promises to be a strong technical program and conference.

Sincerely,

Eduardo Misawa
Program Chair

      <td valign="top"><pre>This paper seeks numerical evidence for cutoffs in chaotic
micro-fluidic mixing, where cutoffs are defined in terms of
a sharp convergence of a discrete Markov chain to a
steady-state solution, especially if this convergence
becomes sharper with increasing order of the Markov chain.
I've been asked to review it as a reviewer who has worked
for some time in the dynamic systems and control theory
areas, but is not an expert in microfluidics. With this in
mind, my review will focus mostly on the structure and
clarity of the paper, rather than its technical content. 

It is very difficult for me to discern the strengths and
contributions of this paper, because its writing is poor
and its structure unfortunately poorer. The authors present
a formal definition of cutoffs, then decide not to use it
in their work because, as they state, it is difficult to
define a cutoff. If it is difficult to define a cutoff, why
did the authors define it? The authors also make very
ambiguous claims such as "people believe cutoffs happen
more frequently than we thought". What does this statement
mean, exactly, and are the authors claiming that cutoffs
exist, or that they don't? The authors also present many of
their equations and symbols without definition, making the
paper very difficult to follow and understand. It is also
not clear why the paper examines cutoffs for different maps
(Baker's map, standard map, etc.), and what the
significance of those maps is. The paper's background
section presents some very basic definitions from
probability space theory, but the connection between these
definitions and fluid flow theory is neither clear from the
context nor explained by the authors. For all of the above
reasons, I cannot strongly recommend this paper for
publication as a reviewer. This is unfortunate, because the
paper may (or may not) contain important contributions to
the literature, but the paper's very poor structure and
presentation make it difficult for me to discern the
paper's contributions as a reviewer. Even if the paper is
very accessible to researchers in the microfluidic chaos
community, it is not very accessible to researchers outside
that community, and is hence unlikely to reach a very wide
audience. &nbsp;</pre></td>

it is still a solid paper. It relates the chaotic
micro&#64258;uidic mixing with a cutoff phenomenon observed
in &#64257;nite Markov chains. 

The mixing strategy studied is passive, in the sense that
it is influenced by fixed system design and hence is not
tunable (certainly not easily) achieve different design
objectives. The authors should acknowledge the existence of
feedback strategies for mixing in boundary-controlled
Navier-Stokes systems in various geometries, such as in
