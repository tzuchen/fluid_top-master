We relax the definition of the cutoff phenomenon in finite Markov Chains and apply it to the study of the evolution of a probability density function by 1-D chaotic maps. A new object called a stochastic symbol sequence is developed to prove that for a set of initial distributions, the total variation versus iteration curves present cutoffs. Moreover, we can generate a set of initial probability
distributions such that when evolved by chaotic maps, they present the same limit behavior as the cutoff sequences found in specific finite Markov Chains. The results can be applied to any 1-D chaotic map that has full symbolic dynamics.



%How many riffle shuffles are required to sufficiently mix 52 cards? This question have been
%answered by Bayer and Diaconis in \cite{Diaconis1992}. It is quite surprising that the cards are
%highly ordered in the first several shuffles (6 for 52 cards) and then randomized almost abruptly.
%This kind of sharp change in some measure of order/disorder has been discovered in many finite
%Markov Chains, and named cutoff phenomenon \cite{Diaconis1986}. A recent review about the cutoff
%phenomenon of random walks on finite groups can be found in \cite{LSaloff-Costt2004}. On the other
%hand, chaotic mixing process is observed to have similar
%properties \cite{Thiffeault2003-13, Thiffeault2004, Tsang2005}. Think of the cream poured
%into coffee, while stirring, the cream keeps stretching for a while and the mixing with coffee
%happens suddenly. Chaotic mixing has been applied in, for example, microfluidic mixing channel
%design \cite{Ottino2004Science, Wiggins2004, Ottino2004}, random search strategies and
%generating random numbers. However, it is still unclear how to characterize and measure the mixing
%process. In this article, we try to build the relation between cutoff phenomenon and the chaotic
%mixing process by generalizing symbolic dynamics of chaotic maps. The result shows ``cutoff'' in
%the mixing process can be produced by chaotic maps with full symbolic dynamics and certain initial
%conditions.

In the next section, we briefly review cutoff phenomenon and point out how a simple chaotic map can produce ``cutoff''. In section \ref{sec:symdyn} we
introduce symbolic dynamics. We define a new object called stochastic symbol sequence, which serves as the main tool to build the bridge
between cutoff phenomenon and chaotic mixing. The main result is given in section \ref{sec:mainresults}, and finally a conclusion in section \ref{sec:symdynconclusion}.
