% basically this is a template file, you should be able to take it and
% start running.

% the philosophy behind this template is that each chapter or
% chapterlike section goes in a separate file and you use the \include
% command to input it into the final document.  The \includeonly
% command can be used so you only need to work on one or two chapters at a
% time (instead of having to either latex the entire book each time or
% losing cross-references and page numbering)

% copy this file and call it something like mythesis.tex

%\documentclass[12pt]{report}
%\documentclass[oneside,10pt,final]{report}
\documentclass[twoside,10pt,final]{report}
%\documentclass[twoside,10pt,draft]{report}
% note that the documentclass can take other option such as
% twoside - for double sided printing
% openright - if double side  chapters always start on odd pages
% openany - if double side chapters start on the next page even or odd
% 12pt can be replaced by 11pt
