In this chapter, we focus on the mixing process of Standard Map in the near-zero diffusion limit. We build a numerical strategy to simulate the map with very high resolution (up to $8 \times 10^4$ by $8 \times 10^4$ grids) and hence very low numerical diffusion. This numerical strategy is realized by a Markov Chain simulation. To characterize the behavior of the variance trajectory in the near-zero diffusion limit, the notion of cutoff in the study of finite Markov Chains is brought. We numerically show that the sequence of models presents a cutoff, which qualitatively characterizes the mixing process when the diffusion goes to zero. The attempt in this chapter is to build a bridge between finite Markov Chain studies and $2$-D chaotic maps with small diffusion. Analytical results of $1$-D chaotic maps with cutoff phenomenon is discussed in next chapter.

This chapter is organized as follows. In section \ref{sec:numcutoffbackground} we briefly review the background of the operators we use and the cutoff phenomenon. Section \ref{sec:modelreduction} provides a model reduction view of building the Markov Chain model of chaotic maps, and the actual numerical strategies we use in simulations. Numerical evidence of Standard Map cutoff is given in section \ref{sec:numresults} and a conclusion in section \ref{sec:numcutoffconclusion}.
