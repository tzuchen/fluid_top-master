I am sincerely grateful to my research advisor Matthew West for his guidance and constant support. He is always there to share his experience and help me to clarify my thoughts. I enjoy every moment of our discussion. 
I thank Sanjay Lall for giving me the first opportunity of doing research at Stanford University, which deeply affects the direction of this thesis. I also wish to thank Michael Saunders for his precious comments for my thesis. 

I thank my friends and colleagues in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics for their help in my defense preparation and the great lunch-times we had.

Finally, I want to share my immense appreciation for the support and encouragement from my family, and their endless love throughout this entire journey.
