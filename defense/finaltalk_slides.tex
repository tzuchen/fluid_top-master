       \begin{itemize}
          \item A linear function of velocity $g(u) = c^Tu$: maximize the downward velocity between the two vortices.
          \item A distance measure between the current flow map and a desired flow map.

\begin{theorem}
Given a $1$-D chaotic map with symbolic dynamics, there exists (and we can construct) a sequence $\omega_n^0$ such that the family
$(\Omega,\bar{\omega},(\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$ presents a Total Variation-cutoff. In fact, let $k =
\frac{1}{4}n\log{n}+cn $ for $c\in \mathbb{R}$. As $n\rightarrow \infty$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{erfbound}
 %|\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \sim \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)
       |\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \sim \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{theorem}

 (Diaconis 1990) For the random walk on an $n$-dimensional hypercube problem, let $k = \frac{1}{4}n\log{n}+cn$ for $c \in \mathbb{R}$. As $n \rightarrow \infty$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{rdwalkshape}
 |\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \sim \erf\left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

 \myframetitle{Idea of Proof}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Claim: The process is composed of many (almost) independent processes $\Longrightarrow$ cutoff.
   \item Random walk on an $n$-dimensional hypercube problem,
         \begin{align*}
          x^0 = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,...)
          \end{align*}
         Each of the coordinates equals $0$ with probability $1$ initially.
   \item $\prob(x^k_i=0)$ and $\prob(x^k_j=0)$, $i \neq j$ are not independent.
   \item When $k$ is large, $\prob(x^k_i=0)$ converges to $\frac{1}{2}$ almost independently for all $i$.
   \item $\prob(x^k_i=0) = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{n-1}{n+1}\right)^k $
   \item $\lambda_2 = \frac{n-1}{n+1}$ with multiplicity $n$.

   \begin{theorem}
   Let $\omega_n^0(x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{i=0}^n \delta^{s_i}_i $, where $\delta_i^L
=\min\{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon_n r_n^i,1\}$,

    \epsilon_n = \sqrt{\frac{n(1-r_n)}{4}}, \,\,\,\,
             r_n = e^{-\frac{2}{n}}
 \end{align}
and $\delta_i^R= 1-\delta_i^L$. The family $(\Omega,\bar{\omega},(\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$ presents a Total Variation-cutoff.
In fact, let $k = \frac{1}{4}n\log{n}+cn $ for $c\in \mathbb{R}$. As $n\rightarrow \infty$,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\label{erfbound}
 %|\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \sim \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)
          \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c-1}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)\le  |\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \le \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Having symbolic dynamics is sufficient to produce cutoffs.
   \item We can create any desired cutoff in a similar way.
