%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Microfluidic systems control and manipulate liquids in microliter or nanoliter scale.
\item Microfluidic mixing channel: objective is to mix two different liquids thoroughly.
\item Reynolds number $\text{Re} = \frac{Ul}{\nu}\approx 1$: flow is laminar.  P\'{e}clet number $\text{Pe} = \frac{Ul}{D} \gg 1$: diffusion is slow comparing with convection.
\item For example: $\text{Pe}=10^5$, the length of a smooth channel required for mixing is $10^3\,\text{cm}$.
\item Chaotic mixing protocols is suggested in the design of mixing channel, and believed to have the best mixing.

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\topsep}{0cm}\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}\setlength{\parsep}{0cm}\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}
\item Goal: design and optimize a passive mixing channel which mixes two separated liquids in short length and microfluidic scale.
\item Use internal structures to stir the flow and produce transverse velocity to enhance the mixing.
\item Flow is laminar, and driven by a constant body force.  The velocity field is fully developed. Both the structure and the velocity are periodical.

  \item Bringing cutoff phenomenon from finite Markov chain studies to chaotic map mixing.
  \item Numerical evidence of Standard map cutoffs.
\end{itemize}
Why Standard map?
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}  \setlength{\itemsep}{5pt} \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
\item Most researches are focused on the property of the map itself, not the Perron-Frobenius or Koopman operators of it.
\item Known numerical results have poor resolution. ($500 \times 500$).
  We use up to $80000\times 80000$ number of grids. $51.2$ Gbytes of memory is required. %to store a single state vector.
\item The issue of numerical diffusion versus physical diffusion.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\newpage
%\oursection{Motivation}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Goal: In the mixing channel problem, we want to evaluate how good the design is by simulating the mixing process for a given structure.
%\item To do this, we need to solve the advection-diffusion equation
%      \begin{eqnarray*}
%       \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \phi = D \triangle \phi
%      \end{eqnarray*}
%      where $\phi$ is a scalar function to denote the "color" of the liquid, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, and $D$ is the diffusibility.
%\item The computaiton cost is a lot.
%\end{itemize}

\oursection{Perron-Frobenius Operator and Koopman Operator}
Given a map $S:X \rightarrow X$. In the measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$,
\begin{definition} {\bfseries (Perron-Frobenius operator)}
Let $f \in L^1$, for every $A \in \mathcal{A}$ the operator $P:L^1 \rightarrow L^1$ satisfies
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \int_A Pf(x)\mu(dx) = \int_{S^{-1}(A)} f(x)\mu(dx)
  \end{eqnarray}
is the Perron-Frobenius operator associated with $S$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition} {\bfseries (Koopman operator)}
Let $f \in L^\infty$. The operator $U:L^{\infty} \rightarrow L^{\infty} $ defined by
 \begin{eqnarray}
 Uf(x) = f(S(x))
 \end{eqnarray}
is called the Koopman operator associated with $S$.
\end{definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\oursection{Scheme}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a discrete-time map $S:X\rightarrow X$.
\item Find either the Perron-Frobenius operator or the Koopman operator of $S$. 
\item The operator can be reduced by model reduction techniques. The result is a \textbf{Markov Chain}.
\item Diffusion can be added by a diffusion operator in spatial domain or in frequency domain.  \
\item This is also the strategy we use to approximate the solution of advection-diffusion equation of mixing channels.

Assume that, to any
finite set $\Omega$ and any pair of probability measures $\omega$, $\bar{\omega}$ on $\Omega$ is associated a real number
$D(\omega,\bar{\omega})$ such that $D(\omega,\bar{\omega})\in [0,1]$, $\max_{\Omega,\omega,\bar{\omega}} D(\omega,\bar{\omega}) = 1$
and $D(\omega,\bar{\omega})=0$ if and only if $\bar{\omega}=\omega$. Consider a sequence of
(finite) probability spaces $(\Omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n)$, $n=1,2,...$, each equipped with a sequence
of probability measure $\omega^k_n$, $k=0,1,...$, such that
$\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} D(\omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n)=0$.
The definition of a cutoff is,

\begin{definition}
\label{cutoffdefinition} (Diaconis) A family $(\Omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n, (\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$ presents a D-cut-off if
there exists a sequence $(t_n)$ of positive reals such that, for any $\epsilon \in(0,1)$,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}D(\omega^{k_n}_n,\bar{\omega}_n) = 0 \mbox{ if }
  k_n>(1+\epsilon)t_n$
  \item $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}D(\omega^{k_n}_n,\bar{\omega}_n) = 1 \mbox{ if }
  k_n<(1-\epsilon)t_n $

\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: Generate a sequence of $\omega_n^0$ such that when they are evolved by a chaotic map, $|\omega_n^k-\bar{\omega}|_{TV}$ has the same limiting behavior as one sees in the random walk on an $n$-dimensional hypercube problem.
\end{itemize}
We do:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observe why RW has the ``normal'' cutoff shape.
\item Overcome the problem of evolving $\omega_n^k$ for a set of $\omega_n^0\in\bar{\Omega}$, by extending the symbolic dynamics of chaotic maps.
\item Find the upper and lower bounds of $|\omega_n^k-\bar{\omega}|_{TV}$, which characterize the limiting behavior of it.

\begin{theorem}\textbf{Lower Bound.}
\label{theoremlb}
$\delta$ and $\bar{\delta}$ are two stochastic symbol sequences, each corresponds to the probability distribution $\omega$ and the invariant distribution $\bar{\omega}$, respectively. Suppose there is a set $\theta \subset \mathbb{Z}^++\{0\} $, $|\theta|=p$ such that for all $i \in \theta$, $|\delta_i-\frac{1}{2}|>\epsilon$, then
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{lbineq}
|\omega-\bar{\omega}|_{TV} \ge \mathbf{I}_{\frac{1}{2}}(p-k^*,k^*+1) - \mathbf{I}_{\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}(p-k^*,k^*+1)
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{kstar}
k^* =  \left\lfloor p \frac{\log{2}+\log{(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)} }{\log{(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)}-\log{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon})} \right\rfloor
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the regularized incomplete beta function.
\end{theorem}
In this theorem, we bound $|\omega-\bar{\omega}|_{TV}$ by choosing $\hat{\delta}_\star = \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\omega_n^0 \in \bar{\Omega}$ has stochastic symbol sequence as the following,

\vspace{-1cm}

 \begin{eqnarray}
    \psi(\omega^0_n) =  \{.\delta_0 \delta_1 \delta_2 \cdots\}
 \end{eqnarray}
where $\delta_i = \min\{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon_n r_n^i,1\}$, and
 \begin{align}
 %\begin{split}
   \epsilon_n = \sqrt{\frac{n(1-r_n)}{4}}, \,\,\,\,
            r_n = e^{-\frac{2}{n}}
 %\end{split}
 \end{align}
The family $(\Omega,\bar{\omega},(\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$ presents a Total Variation-cutoff. In fact,
Let $k = \frac{1}{4}n\log{n}+cn $, then for fixed $c\in \{-\infty,\infty\}$. as $n\rightarrow \infty$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{erfbound}
 %|\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \sim \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)
          \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c-1}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)\le  |\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \le \erf \left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}  \setlength{\itemsep}{5pt} \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
\item We successfully prove that one can generate a sequence of $\omega_n^0$ such that when they are evolved by any $1$-D chaotic map with symbolic dynamics, the family $(\Omega,\bar{\omega},(\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$ presents a Total Variation-cutoff, with desired cutoff time ($t_n$) and normal shape.
\item We achieve this by
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item Understanding what makes a cutoff with normal shapes.
   \item Finding a subspace $\bar{\Omega}$ where we can evolve a probability distribution easily.
   \item Bounding $\omega^k_n$ by binomial distributions in a further reduced space.
 \end{enumerate}
