\item Given a map $S:X \rightarrow X$. In the measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$,
\item {\bfseries (Perron-Frobenius operator)}
Let $f \in L^1$, for every $A \in \mathcal{A}$ the operator $P:L^1 \rightarrow L^1$ satisfies
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \int_A Pf(x)\mu(dx) = \int_{S^{-1}(A)} f(x)\mu(dx)
  \end{eqnarray}
is the Perron-Frobenius operator associated with $S$.



\item {\bfseries (Koopman operator)}
Let $f \in L^\infty$. The operator $U:L^{\infty} \rightarrow L^{\infty} $ defined by
 \begin{eqnarray}
 Uf(x) = f(S(x))
 \end{eqnarray}
is called the Koopman operator associated with $S$.

         Then $\psi:\bar{\Omega} \rightarrow \Delta$ is invertible.

    \item For $\omega \in \bar{\Omega}$, $\delta^L_i=\psi(\omega)_i = \beta^L_i$ for all $i$
    \item For $x \in \Lambda$ having pdf $\omega\in \bar{\Omega}$, and any $s^*\in \Sigma$, one has

\begin{theorem}\textbf{Lower Bound.}
\label{theoremlb}
$\delta$ and $\bar{\delta}$ are two stochastic symbol sequences, each corresponds to the probability distribution $\omega$ and the invariant distribution $\bar{\omega}$, respectively. Suppose there is a set $\theta \subset \mathbb{Z}^++\{0\} $, $|\theta|=p$ such that for all $i \in \theta$, $|\delta_i-\frac{1}{2}|>\epsilon$, then
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{lbineq}
|\omega-\bar{\omega}|_{TV} \ge \mathbf{I}_{\frac{1}{2}}(p-k^*,k^*+1) - \mathbf{I}_{\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}(p-k^*,k^*+1)
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{kstar}
k^* =  \left\lfloor p \frac{\log{2}+\log{(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)} }{\log{(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)}-\log{(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon})} \right\rfloor
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the regularized incomplete beta function.
\end{theorem}
In this theorem, we bound $|\omega-\bar{\omega}|_{TV}$ by choosing $\hat{\delta}_\star = \frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$.
