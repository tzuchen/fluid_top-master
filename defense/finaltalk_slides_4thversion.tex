\begin{itemize}
\item Microfluidic systems control and manipulate liquids in microliter or nanoliter scale.
\item Microfluidic mixing channel: objective is to mix two different liquids thoroughly.
\item Reynolds number $\text{Re} = \frac{Ul}{\nu}\approx 1$: flow is laminar.  P\'{e}clet number $\text{Pe} = \frac{Ul}{D} \gg 1$: diffusion is slow comparing with convection.
\item For example: $\text{Pe}=10^5$, the length of a smooth channel required for mixing is $10^3\,\text{cm}$. It grows linearly with $\text{Pe}$.
\item Chaotic mixing protocols is suggested in the design of mixing channel, and believed to have the best mixing.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A typical topology optimization problem is to distribute a given amount of material in a design domain subject to load and support conditions such that the stiffness of the structure is maximized.
  \item No initial knowledge about the structure.
  \item When applying to the mixing channel design,
  \begin{itemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}  \setlength{\itemsep}{5pt} \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
    \item A large problem ($144\times 24\times 72$ fluid/structure grids: over $10^6$ variables.)

    %\item No clear defined measure of mixing.

  We use up to $80000\times 80000$ number of grids. $51.2$ Gbytes of memory is required. %to store a single state vector.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given a map $S:X \rightarrow X$. In the measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$,
\begin{definition} {\bfseries (Perron-Frobenius operator)}
Let $f \in L^1$, for every $A \in \mathcal{A}$ the operator $P:L^1 \rightarrow L^1$ satisfies
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \int_A Pf(x)\mu(dx) = \int_{S^{-1}(A)} f(x)\mu(dx)
  \end{eqnarray}
is the Perron-Frobenius operator associated with $S$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition} {\bfseries (Koopman operator)}
Let $f \in L^\infty$. The operator $U:L^{\infty} \rightarrow L^{\infty} $ defined by
 \begin{eqnarray}
 Uf(x) = f(S(x))
 \end{eqnarray}
is called the Koopman operator associated with $S$.

\item The operator can be reduced by model reduction techniques. The result is a \textbf{Markov Chain}.
\item Diffusion can be added by a diffusion operator in spatial domain or in frequency domain.  \

\item Goal: Generate a sequence of $\omega_n^0$ such that when they are evolved by a chaotic map, $|\omega_n^k-\bar{\omega}|_{TV}$ has the same limiting behavior as one sees in the random walk on an $n$-dimensional hypercube problem.
\end{itemize}
We do:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observe why RW has the ``normal'' cutoff shape.
\item Overcome the problem of evolving $\omega_n^k$ for a set of $\omega_n^0\in\bar{\Omega}$, by extending the symbolic dynamics of chaotic maps.
\item Find the upper and lower bounds of $|\omega_n^k-\bar{\omega}|_{TV}$, which characterize the limiting behavior of it.

\item Two urns and $n$ balls. To start, all the balls are in urn $1$. Each time, a ball is randomly chosen and moved to the other urn.
\item The state of the Markov chain is the number of balls in urn $1$.
\item The system has $n+1$ states, and $\bar{\omega}(i) = {n \choose i}/2^n$.
\item This problem is equivalent to the random walk on a hypercube problem--as if we put all the states having equal distance to $\mathbf{0}$ together to becomes a new state.

\begin{itemize}%\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}  \setlength{\itemsep}{5pt} \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
\item We show that it is possible to generate a sequence of $\omega_n^0$ such that when they are evolved by any $1$-D chaotic map with symbolic dynamics, they present the desired cutoff.
\item We can create any cutoff with normal shape by the same way. 
\item Having symbolic dynamics is sufficient to produce cutoff.

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Almost'' independency. 
\item In the random walk on an hypercube problem, the initial state can be represented as,
\begin{equation*}
    x_n^0 = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,...) 
\end{equation*}
Each of the coordinate equals $0$ with probability $1$. When $k$ is large the probabilities converge to $\frac{1}{2}$ almost independently.  
\item The symbolic dynamics provides the platform of independency.  

%\item "To people studying finite Markov chains, the fact theorem 3.1 can be proved at all appears like a miracle." - Laurent Saloff-Coste, Probability on Discrete Structures.
