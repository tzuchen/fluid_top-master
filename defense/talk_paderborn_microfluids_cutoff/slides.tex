  \begin{itemize}
  \item The basic model of riffle shuffles was introduced by Gilbert
    and Shannon (1955) and Reeds (1981).
    \item A deck of $n = 52$ cards is cut into two piles according to
      the binomial distribution so the chance that pile one has $j$
      cards is ${n \choose j}/2^n$.
    \item Then sequentially drop cards from the bottoms of the two piles
      according to the following rule: if at some stage pile one has $A$
      cards and pile two has $B$ cards, drop the next card from pile one
      with probability $A/(A+B)$.
    \item This is continued until the two piles are exhausted.

    number, $\mu^0_n$ as initial distribution, $\nu_n$ as invariant
