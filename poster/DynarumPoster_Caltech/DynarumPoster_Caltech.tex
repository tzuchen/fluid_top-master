We state the definition of a cutoff given by Diaconis in
\cite{Diaconis2005}. Assume that, to any finite set $\Omega$ and any
pair of probability measures $\omega$, $\bar{\omega}$ on $\Omega$ is associated
a real number $D(\omega,\bar{\omega})$ such that $D(\omega,\bar{\omega})\in [0,1]$,
%\begin{eqnarray}
$\max_{\{\Omega,\omega,\bar{\omega}\}} D(\omega,\bar{\omega}) = 1$, 
%\end{eqnarray}
and $D(\omega,\bar{\omega})=0$ if and only if $\bar{\omega}=\omega$. Consider a sequence of
(finite) probability spaces $(\Omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n)$, $n=1,2,...$, each
equipped with a sequence of probability measure $\omega^k_n$,
$l=0,1,...$, such that
%\begin{eqnarray}
$\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} D(\omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n)=0$.
%\end{eqnarray}
The definition of a cutoff is,

\begin{definition}
\label{cutoffdefinition}
(Diaconis) A family $(\Omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n, (\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$
presents a D-cutoff if there exists a sequence $(t_n)$ of positive
reals such that, for any $\epsilon \in(0,1)$,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}D(\omega^{k_n}_n,\bar{\omega}_n) = 0 \mbox{ if }
  k_n>(1+\epsilon)t_n$
  \item $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}D(\omega^{k_n}_n,\bar{\omega}_n) = 1 \mbox{ if }
  k_n<(1-\epsilon)t_n $
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We relax the definition and set $\Omega_n$ to be infinite. We say that a family $(\Omega_n,\bar{\omega}_n, (\omega^k_n)_{k=0,1,...})_{n=1,2,...}$ presents a D-cutoff in the relaxed sense if it satisfies definition \ref{cutoffdefinition} but $\Omega_n$ is infinite. 


The distance measure we are interested in is the following: 
\vspace{-0.8cm}

\paragraph{Total Variation Distance}
  \begin{eqnarray*}
   \|\omega^k - \bar{\omega}\|_{TV} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n |\omega_i^k-\bar{\omega}_i |= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n |f_i^k-1|\bar{\omega}_i
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $f^k_i = \omega_i^k/\bar{\omega}_i$. $f$ is the density of $\omega$ with respect to $\bar{\omega}$.

          A particle starts at $\mathbf{0}$ and moves to one of its nearest neighbors (or stays fixed) with equal probability at each step.
    
          [Diaconis 1990] proves the following statement: 
          Let $k = \frac{1}{4}n\log{n}+cn$. Then for fixed $c \in \{-\infty,\infty\}$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$,
        \begin{eqnarray}
        \label{rdwalkshape}
            |\omega^k_n - \bar{\omega} |_{TV} \sim \text{Erf}\left(\frac{e^{-2c}}{\sqrt{8}}\right)

    \omega_{\mu_n}^0 = \left\{ \begin{tabular}{c}
                      $\frac{1}{\mu_n}$, \mbox{  if  } $x \le \mu_n$\\

                      \end{tabular}\right.
     \end{eqnarray}
    where $\mu_1 = 1$, and $\mu_{n+1} = \frac{\mu_n}{2}$ for the tent map and $\mu_{n+1}=\frac{1-\sqrt{1-\mu_n}}{2}$ for the logistic map.
\end{minipage} 
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}
The above two figures show when the tent map or logistic map is applied to evolve a highly concentrated initial distribution, both of them present sharp changes in total variation distance after a certain number of iterations. The behavior of these chaotic maps are similar to the Markov operators which present cutoffs. However, the shapes of the trajectories are different. 

\vspace{-0.5cm}
\paragraph{Stochastic Symbol Sequence}
Consider $\mathcal{S}=\{0, 1\}$ to be the symbol lists. Let $\Delta$ be the collection of all bi-infinite sequence of elements in $[0,1]$. We define $\delta^0 , \delta^1 \in \Delta$ for each symbol.
\vspace{-1.5cm}

 \begin{eqnarray}
 \delta^0 = \{\cdots \delta_{-n}^0\cdots \delta_{-1}^0.\delta_0^0 \delta_1^0\cdots \delta_n^0\cdots\} \nonumber\\
 \delta^1 = \{\cdots \delta_{-n}^1\cdots \delta_{-1}^1.\delta_0^1 \delta_1^1\cdots \delta_n^1\cdots\}
 \end{eqnarray}
\vspace{-1.6cm}

The interpretation of each $\delta_i^0$ is the probability of $x$ belonging to symbol $0$ after $i$ iterations.
Let $\Omega\in L^\infty[\Lambda], \int_\Lambda \Omega dx=1$ denote the space of probability distribution in $\Lambda$. The map $\psi: \Omega \rightarrow \Delta $ maps a probability distribution $\omega(x) \in \Omega$ to the stochastic symbol sequence $\delta^0$( or $\delta^1$) uniquely. However, it is not invertible. So let us consider a smaller space
\vspace{-1.2cm}

  \begin{eqnarray}
  \bar{\Omega} = \left\{ \omega | \omega(x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{i=-n}^n \delta^{s_i}_i \right\}
  \end{eqnarray}
\vspace{-1.2cm}

where $x$ has symbol sequence $s$. Inside $\bar{\Omega}$, we have $P= \psi^{-1}\circ \sigma \circ \psi$, where $P$ is the Perron-Frobenius operator of the map $S$ with full symbolic dynamics. We can prove the following

\begin{theorem}
$\omega^0 \in \bar{\Omega}$ has stochastic symbol sequence $\delta \equiv \psi(\omega^0)$, such that $\delta_i-\frac{1}{2}$ decreases faster than exponential. Let $p  = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \delta_i}{\delta_{0}}$ and $l = \lfloor p(\delta_{0}-\frac{1}{2})\rfloor$. Then

\vspace{-1.3cm}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    {p \choose l}2^{-p} \ll 1  \Rightarrow |\omega^k-\bar{\omega}|_{TV} \mbox{ presents a sharp change}
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{theorem}

\vspace{-0.8cm}
This result can be extended to $\omega \in \Omega$ such that $|\omega- \psi(\omega)|_{TV}$ is small. 
\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{tabular}{c|l}
  \begin{tabular}{cc}

  \begin{minipage}[s]{0.41\hsize}
   The change of total variation distance can be interpreted as the combination of the two effects: the moving(top two figures) and the reshaping(bottom two figures) of the current distribution to the invariant distribution. The proof of the theorem is done by reducing the system dimension to a smaller space, and then bounding the total variation distances by the difference between two binomial distributions.
